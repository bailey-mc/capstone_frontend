            <p className="left-align">Art Gallery was developed by <a href="https://github.com/bailey-mc" className="custom-link" traget="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Bailey McDonald</a> as her capstone project for her tenure as a Software Engineering Fellow with General Assembly. For their capstone projects, students were tasked with learning something entirely new to them. I chose to build a Web API with a backend written in C# and .NET, and a front end built with React and React Router. I taught myself C# and .NET in a matter of days in order to build the back end for this project. Shout out to <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/" target="_blank" className="custom-link" rel="noreferrer">Microsoft Learn</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoc4UCEetAt3htM3hV1dQgQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" className="custom-link">Alex Merced</a> for their rigorous tutorials and documentation. On the front end, I created a React app and became very familiar with React Router.</p>
